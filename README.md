========

GS2 is a gyrokinetic flux tube initial value turbulence code which can be used for fusion or astrophysical plasmas. CodeRunner is a framework for the automated running and analysis of large simulations. This module allows GS2 (and its sister code AstroGK) to harness the power of the CodeRunner framework.

Coding Style Guide
==================

These bullet points are taken from here: https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide

* Indentation is strictly two spaces, i.e. not tabs.
* Where possible do not exceed 80 columns. This makes the code much more readable.
* Do not sign your initials when contributing code, this is what revision control is for.
* Avoid unnecessary comments or inline comments, try to write code which is self documenting or have a short comment preceding your code.
* Do not use the ';' character to write several statements on one line.
* If in doubt refer to the style guide.
