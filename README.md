========

GS2 is a gyrokinetic flux tube initial value turbulence code which can be used for fusion or astrophysical plasmas. CodeRunner is a framework for the automated running and analysis of large simulations. This module allows GS2 (and its sister code AstroGK) to harness the power of the CodeRunner framework.
